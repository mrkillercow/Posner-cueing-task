# Posner-cueing-task
Posner cueing paradigm as first described by Posner, Nissen and Ogden (1978). This present version of spatial cueing paradigm is a modified version of the original, by using exogenous cues, circles as targets that are presented inside empty square outlines ("boxes"). This present version only studies subjects' covert spatial attention to one specific target, rather than different forms of targets.
